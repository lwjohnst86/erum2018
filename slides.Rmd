## Outline brainstorm

- intro, reason
    - the need and demand for open and transparent sharing of code, projects,
    and scientific output continues to increase
    - will one day be a requirement to publish code and workflow along side 
    the scientific output
- other packages/tools
    - rrtools
    - devtools/usethis directly
    - ProjectTemplate
    - makeProject
- need/gap
    - many scientists and researchers (at least within health/medicine research)
    don't know what open science/source is
    - don't know how to share, or may want to but don't know where to begin
    - many tools and services already available... lots of choice, but is overwhelming
    - there are many "moving parts" to an open scientific project because of these
    diverse set of specific tools/services to use (GitHub, DOI generators like
    figshare or Zenodo, Git, R ... {{others}}).
- outline of current package prodigenr
    - I started prodigenr in my Phd
    - proj generator
        - image of folder structure
    - why these formats
    - vignette of "manifesto"
- how this helps... first steps
    - open science constantly evolving 
    - automates and bundles together common open science tools (of course, strongly
    opinionated on which tools to use)
- Current stage:
    - part of Mozilla Open Project Leader training
    - Featured on Mozilla Pulse and went through Global Sprint
    - Next version just submitted to CRAN
- future goals
    - focus current prodigenr on only  project generation
    - expand other functionality to new package, rostools, including prodigenr
    - more extensive documentation
    - teaching material
    - automated set up of reproducible tools/structure (docker)
    - Link to issues and goals/plans/other things
- Why did I present this here?
    - Biggest reason: looking for contributors, feedback, thoughts, ideas
    - Contact: links to DOI of slides/github.
