# Abstract (1850 characters max?)

Many fields of science are slow to adopt open scientific practices (e.g. sharing
code), especially in the biomedical fields. Given the increasing calls and
demands for science to be more open (open data, open source) and reproducible,
these practices will increasingly become requirements to publish papers and
obtain funding. However, one of the biggest challenges for many researchers is
that it is difficult to adhere to open and reproducible science principles.
While there are a few packages and workflows currently available, e.g.
[`ProjectTemplate`](http://projecttemplate.net/) or
[`makeProject`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeProject), these packages
tend to focus on template creation or rely on extensive documentation rather
than automation. The [`prodigenr`](https://github.com/lwjohnst86/prodigenr)
package aims to simplify and automate many of these open science tasks.
Presently, the `prodigenr` package automates the creation of an open
reproducible research project, with templates for manuscripts, posters, and
slides currently available. The structure and workflow of the newly created
project emphasizes adhering to reproducible practices (e.g. documenting
dependencies, use of R Markdown for manuscripts with R code chunks, etc). The
ultimate goal is to create a package (or packages) similar in ideology to the
`devtools` package, but aimed at mainly biomedical researchers and scientists
using (or wanting to use) open scientific practices. This package is also being
developed through the Mozilla [Open Project Leader
Training](https://tinyurl.com/y8632w22). The aim is to create an ecosystem of
packages that encourage and automate open science principles. The aim of
presenting this package and ideas at eRum is to get feedback and suggestions
from the community (particularly surrounding practices in reproducibility and
open science), how to best target biomedical researchers, and to find potential
collaborators.
